## 🧠 Technical Highlights

- Uses `Selenium` WebDriver to navigate and scrape u.gg.
- Parallelized scraping using `ConcurrentBag` and `Parallel.ForEach`.
- Robust error handling with crash dump generation (`_debug.html`, `_debug.png`).
- Alias normalization (e.g., `lb` → `LeBlanc`, `vlad` → `Vladimir`).

---

## 🔍 Debugging

If a crash occurs:
- HTML source and screenshot are dumped to `_debug.html` and `_debug.png` for inspection.
- Logs are printed to the console if `--debug` is used.
